Squarespace Website Project

## Project Overview
The project involves developing a **Squarespace website** with a primary focus on **SSBP (Signup, Sign-in, Book, and Pay)** as soon as possible. The key objective is to ensure a seamless and **user-friendly** experience, as the target audience consists primarily of **elderly customers in Zurich, Switzerland**.

## Booking App Selection & Integration
The client is evaluating several **third-party booking applications** that can integrate with any hosting platform via **API**. **Squarespace should not pose a technical limitation**, but selecting the right app is crucial.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Simplicity** â€“ Easy for elderly users to navigate.
2. **Swiss Market Compatibility** â€“ Must support Swiss payment methods, local regulations, and customer preferences.
3. **Integration** â€“ Must work seamlessly with Squarespace.
4. **Cost-effectiveness** â€“ The client is willing to pay for performance but does not want to overpay for unnecessary features.
5. **Long-term viability** â€“ Switching providers later would be difficult, as existing clients would need to re-register. It's worth checking if some providers offer **migration options** to mitigate this risk.

The client has conducted some **initial research** of booking apps they are considering. However, they need expert guidance, as they **cannot fully field-test** the options before committing.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: MVP Development
- Once the **booking app is selected**, an **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** needs to be launched on **Squarespace** as soon as possible.

### Phase 2: Full Website Development
- The client will provide:
  - A **site map** with content.
  - A **corporate identity (CI)** for branding consistency.
- Developers will provide **cost and time estimates** based on these materials.
- The goal is to have a **presentable version of the site** by **May 2025**. However, if more time is needed, the project can be delivered in **sub-phases**.

## CI Design Book
A **Corporate Identity (CI) Design Book** as been provided by the client to ensure brand consistency. This document outlines the design principles, typography, color schemes, and branding guidelines to be followed during development.
